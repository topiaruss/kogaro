# Monitoring Extension Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the monitoring setup implemented for the application. The goal was to provide robust, secure, and accessible monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager.

## Components
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **Alertmanager**: Alert handling and notifications

## Key Configurations
- **Ingress**: Each component is exposed via its own subdomain (e.g., `prometheus.ogaro.com`, `grafana.ogaro.com`, `alertmanager.ogaro.com`) with TLS and basic authentication.
- **Basic Authentication**: Prometheus is secured with basic auth using a Kubernetes secret.
- **TLS**: Certificates are managed by cert-manager using Let's Encrypt.

## Files
- `k8s/ingress.yaml`: Ingress configuration for Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager
- `k8s/app-ingress.yaml`: Ingress configuration for the main application

## Next Steps
- Verify DNS and TLS on the new instance
- Configure Grafana dashboards and Alertmanager rules
- Integrate with existing monitoring tools if needed
