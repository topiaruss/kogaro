# Kogaro Testing Log

## Session Goals
- ‚úÖ **Step 1: Add Error Codes to Metrics** - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **Step 2: Create Enhanced Dashboard** - COMPLETED
- üîÑ **Step 3: Target Real Issues** - IN PROGRESS

## Current Status: Step 2 COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### Step 2: Enhanced Dashboard with Error Code Integration - SUCCESSFUL
**Date:** 2025-07-24  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  

#### Changes Made:
1. **Created Enhanced Dashboard** (`dashboards/kogaro-temporal-dashboard-error-codes.json`):
   - Added error code filtering dropdown
   - Fixed issue age panel to show hours instead of UNIX timestamps
   - Enhanced heatmap visualization for error types vs namespaces
   - Added comprehensive filtering (Namespace, Severity, Workload Category, Error Code)

2. **Updated Documentation** (`dashboards/README.md`):
   - Documented all available dashboards
   - Added error code categories and usage examples
   - Included troubleshooting and maintenance notes
   - Added import instructions and usage examples

3. **Cleaned Up Testbed**:
   - Removed `kogaro-testbed` namespace to eliminate noise
   - Dashboard now shows only real issues for analysis

#### Dashboard Features:
- **Error Code Filtering**: Filter by specific error codes (KOGARO-SEC-001, KOGARO-RES-001, etc.)
- **Temporal Heatmap**: Shows error patterns over time with error types vs namespaces
- **Issue Age Tracking**: Displays how long problems have been present in hours
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Multiple dropdown filters for focused analysis
- **Color-coded Values**: Green (0), Yellow (1-9), Red (10+) for quick prioritization

#### Testing Results:
- ‚úÖ Dashboard imports successfully into Grafana 12.0.2
- ‚úÖ Error code filtering works correctly
- ‚úÖ Heatmap shows temporal patterns
- ‚úÖ Issue age panel displays meaningful hour values
- ‚úÖ All filtering dropdowns populate correctly

## Step 3: Real Issue Targeting - IN PROGRESS üîÑ

### Current Focus: Document Issues Found and Fixed
**Date:** 2025-07-24  
**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS  

#### Issues Found and Fixed:

##### 1. **Testbed Noise Removal** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Testbed generating artificial validation errors cluttering dashboard
- **Action**: Removed `kogaro-testbed` namespace completely
- **Result**: Clean dashboard data focused on real issues
- **Learning**: Important to separate test data from production analysis

##### 2. **Dashboard JSON Syntax Error** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Trailing comma in JSON causing import failures
- **Action**: Fixed JSON syntax and committed correction
- **Result**: Dashboard imports successfully
- **Learning**: Always validate JSON before committing dashboard files

##### 3. **Issue Age Panel Display** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Panel showing UNIX timestamps instead of readable hours
- **Action**: Modified query to calculate age in hours: `(time() - timestamp) / 3600`
- **Result**: Panel now shows meaningful hour values
- **Learning**: Prometheus timestamp metrics need conversion for human-readable display

##### 4. **Missing Error Codes in Dashboard** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Error Code dropdown only shows "All" - no actual error codes available
- **Root Cause**: Kogaro pod is running old version (97 minutes old) without error code integration
- **Evidence**: Prometheus shows 315 validation errors but no `error_code` label present
- **Action**: Rebuilt and redeployed Kogaro with error code integration
- **Result**: Error codes now available in Prometheus and dashboard dropdown
- **Learning**: Dashboard features depend on deployed application version - need to redeploy after code changes

##### 5. **Logging Error Code Issue** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Error codes not appearing in Kogaro logs despite being in Prometheus metrics
- **Root Cause**: LogReceiver interface and implementations not passing/logging ErrorCode field
- **Evidence**: KOGARO-SEC-011 present in Prometheus but missing from log output
- **Action**: Updated LogReceiver interface to accept ValidationError object and extract ErrorCode
- **Result**: Error codes now appearing correctly in logs (e.g., KOGARO-SEC-011, KOGARO-RES-001)
- **Learning**: Interface changes require updates to all implementations (DirectLogReceiver, BufferedLogReceiver, MockLogReceiver)

##### 6. **Diagnostic Code Cleanup** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Temporary diagnostic code forcing "NO_ERROR_CODE" display in logs
- **Action**: Removed diagnostic code that was artificially showing "NO_ERROR_CODE" for empty error codes
- **Result**: Clean logging that shows actual error codes or empty strings as intended
- **Learning**: Always clean up diagnostic code after troubleshooting

#### Issues to Investigate:
- [ ] **Security Issues**: Filter by KOGARO-SEC-* codes to identify security problems
- [ ] **Resource Limits**: Filter by KOGARO-RES-* codes to find resource issues
- [ ] **Cross-Namespace Patterns**: Use heatmap to identify widespread problems
- [ ] **Long-standing Issues**: Use issue age panel to prioritize old problems

#### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Error codes now appearing correctly in Kogaro logs (e.g., KOGARO-SEC-011, KOGARO-RES-001, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Docker image rebuilt and deployed with logging fixes
- ‚úÖ Security validation errors properly logged with error codes
- ‚úÖ Diagnostic code cleaned up
- üîÑ Ready to proceed with fixing real security issues using the chart data

#### Next Actions:
1. **Analyze Dashboard Data**: Use filtering to identify specific issue types
2. **Document Findings**: Record what issues are found in real namespaces
3. **Prioritize Fixes**: Use temporal intelligence to determine which issues to tackle first
4. **Track Resolution**: Monitor how issues change as fixes are applied

## Tomorrow's Plan üóìÔ∏è

### Priority 1: Real Issue Analysis & Fixing
1. **Dashboard Analysis Session** (30-45 min)
   - Open Grafana dashboard and filter by KOGARO-SEC-* codes
   - Identify the most critical security issues (highest counts, oldest age)
   - Focus on non-system namespaces first (avoid kube-system, cert-manager noise)
   - Document findings in TEST_LOG.md

2. **Target Specific Issues** (1-2 hours)
   - Pick 2-3 high-priority issues to fix
   - Use kubectl to investigate the specific resources
   - Apply fixes (e.g., add resource limits, fix security contexts)
   - Monitor dashboard to see validation errors resolve

3. **Track Resolution** (30 min)
   - Watch how issue counts change after fixes
   - Verify temporal intelligence shows "resolved" state
   - Document the fix process and results

### Priority 2: Dashboard Enhancement (Optional)
4. **2D Matrix Table** (1-2 hours)
   - Now that error codes are reliable, attempt the 2D matrix again
   - Use organize + rowsToFields transformations
   - Error codes as rows, namespaces as columns, counts in cells
   - Color coding based on severity

### Priority 3: Documentation & Cleanup
5. **Update Documentation** (30 min)
   - Document successful fixes in TEST_LOG.md
   - Update any relevant README files
   - Create a "fixes applied" summary

### Success Criteria for Tomorrow:
- ‚úÖ Identify and fix at least 2 real security/resource issues
- ‚úÖ See validation errors resolve in the dashboard
- ‚úÖ Document the process for future reference
- ‚úÖ (Optional) Successfully implement the 2D matrix table

### Notes:
- Start with the dashboard analysis - it's the foundation for everything else
- Focus on real impact rather than perfecting the dashboard
- The logging fix we completed today makes everything else much easier
